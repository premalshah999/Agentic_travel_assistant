##  Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MananxRobin/Agentic_travel_assistant
cd Agentic_travel_assistant
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
You'll need to configure your API keys.

-   **OpenAI API Key**:
    -   Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
    -   Add your OpenAI API key to this file:
        ```
        OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
        ```

-   **Google Calendar API Credentials**:
    1.  Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    2.  Create a new project.
    3.  Enable the "Google Calendar API" for that project.
    4.  Go to "Credentials," click "Create Credentials," and choose "OAuth client ID."
    5.  Select "Desktop app" as the application type.
    6.  Download the JSON file and rename it to `credentials.json`.
    7.  Place this `credentials.json` file in the root directory of the project.

    *Note: The first time you run the application, you will be prompted to authorize access to your Google Calendar through a browser window.*

### 5. Run the App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
